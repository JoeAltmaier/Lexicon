       LEXICON

 Welcome to Lexicon, the word
 game that tests your vocabulary!

 There are three sub-games in 
 Lexicon:

Shuffle
 Slide tiles around to make words. 
 Each move counts against the 
 clock.

Shuffle-Clocked
 Beat the Clock! Moving doesn't
 count against you.

Crash
 Swap tiles and try to clear the 
 board!
 Bonus for clearing the board
 completely.


The Board:

 Lexicon has an 8X8 tile playing
 board.  Touch and drag letter
 tiles to spell words.

 Below the tiles are 
  the clock, 
  the Discard Box,
  the Score,
  the current Bonus Word and 
  the Best Word.

 At the bottom are the buttons: 
  Quit, New, Pause and Mute.


Game Play:

 The game starts with the board
 full of tiles.

 In Shuffle, the tiles automatically
 slide under the stylus as you drag.  
 Lift the stylus to drop a tile at the
 desired location.

 In Crash, touch and drag a tile the
 same way. When you drop it, it
 swaps places  with the tile at that
 location.
 
 When you spell words, they will
 flash and disappear, showing their
 score.

  Got a letter you can't use?  
  Just drag it to the discard box.
  You get another for free.
  But don't do it too often!
  You only get three chances.

 Keep playing until you get stuck,
 or until you win the level.

 Quit stops the game and gives
 your score. In crash, letters left on
 the board count against your
 score!

 Touch Quit again to return to the
 main menu.

 New abandons the game and
 starts a new game at level 1.

 Pause stops the clock. Touch it
 again to continue.

 Mute turns off sound. Touch it
 again to get sounds back.


Scoring:

 Valid words can be left-to-right or
 top- to-bottom, but not diagonal.
 No plurals, past tenses or other
 inflections allowed.

 So lovely is ok, but not lovelies,
 lovelier or loveliest.

 No proper names allowed.

 Longer words count:

 Letters   Score
    4           100
    5           200
    6           300
    7           400
    8           500

 Bonus letters are colored, and
 multiply the word value.  Use
 several bonus letters in one word
 for super scores!

 Example:

 Word bonus starts at 1X and goes
 up like this:

   A
   B
   C
   D
   E
   F   +1
   G 
   H   +1
   I
   J   +2
   K   +1
   L
   M
   N
   O
   P
   Q   +3
   R
   S
   T
   U
   V   +1
   W   +1
   X   +2
   Y   +1
   Z   +3

 Word:         W A V Y
 Bonus = 1  +1  +1+1 = 4

  WAVY  = 100 X 4 = 400!

 Make more than one word in
 a single swap, and get a
 multi-word bonus.

 For example:

    MCOXANOR

 Swap the M and X making

    XCOMANOR

 which is COMA + MANOR.

  COMA = 100
  MANOR = 200 + 100!

 If other words are made vertically
 at the same time, the score adds
 up fast!

 Words within words don't count.
 So cowboy is just one word, not
 three.

 If you spell the Bonus Word, it
 counts 10X its normal score!
 Then a new bonus word is
 chosen.

 Your best-scoring word of the
 game is shown under "Best Word".
 

Configuration:
