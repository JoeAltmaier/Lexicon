       LEXICON

 Welcome to Lexicon, the word game that tests your vocabulary!

 There are three sub-games in 
 Lexicon (only Crash in the first release)

Shuffle
 Slide tiles around to make words. Each move counts against the clock.

Shuffle-Clocked
 Beat the Clock! Moving doesn't count against you.

Crash
 Swap tiles and try to clear the board!
 Bonus for clearing the board completely.


The Board:

 Lexicon has an 8X8 tile playing board. Touch and drag letter tiles to spell words.
 Correct words (words in our dictionary or the Bonus Word List) will 'burn' 
 and tiles fall from above to fill the gap.

 Below the tiles are 
  the clock, 
  the Discard Box,
  the Score,
  the current Bonus Word and 
  the Best Word.

 At the bottom are the buttons: 
  Quit, New, Pause and Mute.


Game Play:

 The game starts with the board full of tiles.

 Touch and drag a tile. When you drop it, it swaps places with the tile at the drop location.
 When you spell words under the dropped tile they will flash and disappear, showing their score.

 Keep playing until you get stuck, or until you clear the level. 
 When no more words are possible (no block of tiles four or longer, or no words in the dictionary that match)
 the level is also over.

 Quit stops the game and gives your score. Letters left on the board count against your score!

 Touch Quit again to return to the main menu.

 New abandons the game and starts a new game at level 1.

 Mute turns off sound. Touch it again to get sounds back.


Scoring:

 Valid words can be left-to-right or top- to-bottom, but not diagonal.
 No plurals, past tenses or other inflections allowed.

 So lovely is ok, but not lovelies, lovelier or loveliest.

 No proper names are in the dictionary.

 Longer words count:

 Letters   Score
    4           100
    5           200
    6           300
    7           400
    8           500

 Bonus letters are colored, and multiply the word value.  Use several bonus letters in one word for super scores!

 Example:

 Word bonus starts at 1X and goes up like this:

   A
   B
   C
   D
   E
   F   +1
   G 
   H   +1
   I
   J   +2
   K   +1
   L
   M
   N
   O
   P
   Q   +3
   R
   S
   T
   U
   V   +1
   W   +1
   X   +2
   Y   +1
   Z   +3

 Word:         W A V Y
 Bonus = 1    +1  +1+1 = 4

  WAVY  = 100 X 4 = 400!

 Make more than one word in a single swap, and get a multi-word bonus.

 For example:

    MCOXANOR

 Swap the M and X making

    XCOMANOR

 which is COMA + MANOR.

  COMA = 100
  MANOR = 200 + 100!

 If other words are made vertically at the same time, the score adds up fast!

 Words within words don't count. So cowboy is just one word, not three.

 If you spell the Bonus Word, it counts 10X its normal score!
 Then a new bonus word is chosen.

 Your best-scoring word of the game is shown under "Best Word".
 
Dictionary

 Lexicon comes with a 21,000 word dictionary of American English.
